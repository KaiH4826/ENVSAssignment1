#### Introduction
This article explores the possibility of the recently returned climate pattern called La Niña within the currents of the Pacific Ocean negatively influencing the upcoming growing season on the west coast with droughts as well as increased violence in the current and future hurricane season. Part of a back and forth cycle affecting sea surface temperatures and the climate surrounding the Pacific (ENSO) El Niño is the largest part of the cycle, lasting around a two-year period that brings warm water to the equator, while La Nina comes around every few years for only a few months to bring colder water. The affect this has can greatly influence the frequency and strength of upcoming hurricane seasons for better or worse.

#### Methods
Predictions made by NOAA researchers are based on data models that record periodic surface sea temperatures within the Pacific Ocean as well as wind speeds over areas prone to hurricanes like the tropical Atlantic Basin and the Caribbean Sea. 
In addition, NOAA also predicted back in August what the 2020 hurricane season would be like in terms of overall activity and ranking. They came to this prediction by judging the speed and intensity that the water temperature was “flipping” from warm to overly cold.

#### Results
The results included confirming data of rapidly cooling surface sea temperatures in the equatorial Pacific as well as the recorded speed of wind shear in the western Atlantic was being weakened. This is the opposite of data recorded during previous El Niño events.

#### Conclusions
From these results, NOAA was able to confirm that La Niña was indeed coming into full swing and would probably take place between December 2020 and February 2021. This means that while the water cools and shear wind speeds drop, the natural suppressant given by El Niño will fade and instead an increase in water and air temperature meant that hurricanes will probably be more common/stronger, as well as a lack of moist air on the west coast of North America could indeed spell drought for important Agricultural centers in California for example. The 2020 hurricane season would also likely end late and continue in very strong hurricane be ranked as one of the most active on record.
